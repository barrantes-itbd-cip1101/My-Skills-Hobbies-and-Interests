    <br><h4>MY CHILDHOOD YEARS</h4> 

    <p><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I relish the fond memories of my childhood, a time marked by carefree joy and genuine happiness. <sup>[1]</sup> <b>Those early years</b> were <i>filled with delightful moments</i> spent playing with my cousins and basking in the unconditional love and attention bestowed upon me by my parents and relatives. <sup>[2]</sup> Being the recipient of such affection made me feel cherished and at times, spoiled in the best possible way. <sup>[3]</sup></p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One <cite>cherished routine</cite> was our merienda sessions in the courtyard, where I carried a small maleta containing my favorite snacks, creating a sense of anticipation and excitement. <sup>[4]</sup> These moments, shared with my Papa, became a source of joy and connection. <sup>[5]</sup> Our family excursions and adventures allowed me to explore life and nature, fostering a deep appreciation for the world around me. <sup>[6]</sup></p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enrolling in a quality school added another layer of enrichment to my childhood, providing opportunities for learning and growth. <sup>[7]</sup> <strong>Reflecting on these experiences</strong>, I am filled with a longing to return to a time when innocence prevailed, and the simplicity of just being myself brought unparalleled contentment. <sup>[8]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those carefree days, there was no need to prove anything, and life was a <cite>tapestry of <strong>joyous moments</strong></cite> that I now hold dear. <sup>[9]</sup> The nostalgia for those carefree years persists, a testament to the authenticity and purity of childhood happiness. <sup>[10]</sup> I can confidently state that my childhood is indeed a treasure; I mean, who wouldn't consider theirs as such? <sup>[11]</sup></p>
  
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, my early years were not confined to a single location, as I used to live in Cavite during my kindergarten days. <sup>[12]</sup> Our family had a house there, and my grandma, in her doting manner, spoiled me. <sup>[13]</sup> However, circumstances led us to relocate to our house in Taguig, where my educational journey began from kindergarten onwards. <sup>[14]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my school years in Taguig, a fascinating opportunity unfolded as I was handpicked by the badminton coach to be a potential varsity player. <sup>[15]</sup> The coach recognized my skills and wanted me to compete at <dfn>APSA-TAPAT</dfn> to represent our school. <sup>[16]</sup> This was a thrilling prospect, but unfortunately, challenges with the required documents emerged, thwarting my chance to become a varsity player and participate in the competition. <sup>[17]</sup> But it is okay for me, since my friend got the chance to give it a shot. <sup>[18]</sup> Iâ€™m happy with that and supported him with happiness. <sup>[19]</sup> Despite this setback, the experience fueled my determination to excel in other aspects of my life, adding another layer to the complex tapestry of my childhood and adolescence. <sup>[20]</sup></p></dd><br><br>
    


    <h4>MY TEENAGE YEARS</h4>

    <p><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my <strong><cite>teenage years</cite></strong>, I underwent a <code>profound awakening</code>, realizing the inherent challenges and occasional disasters that life can present. <sup>[1]</sup> This period of my life prompted a rapid maturation beyond my chronological age, as I grappled with the complexities of existence. <sup>[2]</sup> Taking on the responsibility of self-care and self-reliance became paramount, instilling in me a sense of independence that extended beyond societal expectations. <sup>[3]</sup> Striving to be a positive role model for those in my orbit, I cultivated wisdom that transcended conventional wisdom, navigating the intricacies of real-life situations. <sup>[4]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<var>Reflecting</var> on this phase, I find myself caught between a dichotomy of happiness and weariness, with a sense of trepidation for the impending steps into the <i>next chapter of my life</i>. <sup>[5]</sup> Despite being on the verge of <ins>turning 20</ins>, I still consider myself enveloped in the tapestry of adolescence. <sup>[6]</sup> These formative years were a crucible of learning and unlearning, marked by growth, suffering, loss, and the seizing of opportunities to construct my identity. <sup>[7]</sup> As I venture into the world, I showcased my abilities, overcoming fears and <strong>boldly facing the uncertainties</strong> that lay ahead. <sup>[8]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above all, I discovered the <ins>strength</ins> to confront challenges independently, with only modest assistance from those in my immediate surroundings. <sup>[9]</sup> This period stands as the crucible where I truly came to know myself. Moreover, it instilled in me a profound appreciation for resilience, as I learned to navigate life's twists and turns with unwavering determination. <sup>[10]</sup> The experiences of my teenage years not only equipped me with practical skills but also fueled a sense of purpose and a readiness to embrace the evolving chapters of my journey. <sup>[11]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to these experiences, my journey took an unexpected turn during my high school years. <sup>[12]</sup>Circumstances led our family to relocate once again, this time to my lola's house on my mother's side. <sup>[13]</sup> A tragic event in our lives had turned the house we previously inhabited into a source of trauma, making it untenable for us to continue living there. <sup>[14]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This relocation marked a challenging period, especially during my Grade 9 and 10 years. <sup>[15]</sup> I became exceptionally shy to the point where I barely spoke or participated in class, extracurricular activities, and organizations or clubs. <sup>[16]</sup> The trauma from our previous living situation cast a shadow over my confidence, inhibiting my ability to engage fully in the school community. <sup>[17]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, a turning point came when one of my teachers recognized my potential and convinced me to join the Shakespearean Club, also known as the English Club. <sup>[18]</sup> Initially resistant, I hesitated to audition for the role of emcee for our English Month celebration. <sup>[19]</sup> The event was significant, held in a large venue, and the idea of being on stage intimidated me. <sup>[20]</sup> However, with all members required to audition, I summoned the courage to participate. <sup>[21]</sup> To my surprise, I secured the role of Male emcee. Though challenging, this experience served as a catalyst for boosting my confidence. <sup>[22]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Entering Senior High School (SHS), even amidst the challenges of an online learning environment, I learned to break free from my shell. <sup>[23]</sup> I actively participated in various activities, winning accolades such as <ins><strong>SHS Mr. Mythical Icon 2020 in Mythological Fete</strong></ins> and emerging as the <ins><strong>champion in the Bible Month Quiz Bee</strong></ins>. I embraced the mantra of joining and enjoying, and in doing so, I became a consistent honor student. <sup>[24]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These diverse experiences have woven a rich tapestry of my adolescence, encompassing the struggles, triumphs, and personal growth that have shaped my journey into adulthood. <sup>[25]</sup> They underline the importance of resilience, self-discovery, and the willingness to embrace opportunities, even in the face of challenges. <sup>[26]</sup></dd></p><br><br>
 

    <h4>MY COLLEGE YEARS</h4>

    <p><dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My <strong><cite>college journey</cite></strong> has proven to be a challenging yet enlightening chapter in my life, offering profound lessons about both the world around me and my own identity. <sup>[1]</sup> Throughout my teenage years, I relentlessly pursued excellence, striving to meet the lofty expectations I set for myself in every aspect of life. <sup>[2]</sup> However, college has taught me that the pursuit of perfection and being at the pinnacle is not always the key to success; survival, authenticity, and personal fulfillment matter just as much. <sup>[3]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experience has been a delightful revelation, revealing facets of myself that I thought I already knew. <sup>[4]</sup> The diverse array of people I've encountered, from friends and colleagues to seemingly random strangers, has expanded my understanding of human connections. <sup>[5]</sup> It has made me question the notion that mediocrity is inherently wrong, prompting the <cite>realization</cite> that one doesn't always need to be the best at everything. Simply being oneself and doing things with genuine enjoyment can be enough. <sup>[6]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College has underscored the importance of embracing life for the joy it brings rather than turning everything into a competition. <sup>[7]</sup> It's acceptable to engage in activities purely for the pleasure they bring, without the pressure of excelling or outperforming others. <sup>[8]</sup> The revelation that one doesn't need an exhaustive knowledge of history or any subject matter to exist comfortably is liberating. <sup>[9]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I still maintain a degree of concern for grades and seek academic validation, there's a newfound acceptance that perfection is not the sole measure of success. <sup>[10]</sup> Striking a balance between academic conscientiousness and the pursuit of personal happiness has become a defining aspect of my college experience, with a lighthearted acknowledgment that aiming for 50% is perfectly okay. <sup>[11]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, my college journey has been enriched by my active involvement in various organizations. <sup>[12]</sup> During my first year, I became a member of <abbr title="COmputer Students SOciety">COMSSO</abbr>. Over time, my commitment and passion for the organization grew, leading me to take on a more significant role. <sup>[13]</sup> Currently, I proudly serve as the Vice President for Internal Affairs of <abbr title="COmputer Students SOciety">COMSSO</abbr>, where I am responsible for handling seminars, academic matters, papers, and other internal affairs. <sup>[14]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being part of COMSSO has become more than just a commitment; it is a source of joy and fulfillment. <sup>[15]</sup> I find myself immersed in the intricacies of organizing seminars, addressing academic concerns, and collaborating with fellow members to create a vibrant and supportive community. <sup>[16]</sup> This role not only allows me to contribute meaningfully to the organization but also provides a platform for personal and professional growth. <sup>[17]</sup> Additionally, I am currently exploring the possibility of extending my involvement in campus organizations. <sup>[18]</sup> Recently, I filled out a form to join the UE Red Cross Youth Council. <sup>[19]</sup></p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In embracing this responsibility, I've discovered a newfound love for what I do and thoroughly enjoy the challenges and opportunities it brings. <sup>[21]</sup> It has reinforced the idea that success is not solely measured by individual achievements but is also derived from collective efforts and the positive impact we make within our community. <sup>[22]</sup> Through my role in <abbr title="COmputer Students SOciety">COMSSO</abbr>, I've learned to appreciate the significance of balance, not only in academics but also in fostering a sense of belonging, camaraderie, and shared purpose within the college community. <sup>[23]</sup></dd></p>
